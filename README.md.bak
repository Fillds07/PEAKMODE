# PEAKMODE Application

PEAKMODE is a mobile application designed to help users reach their peak performance by providing energy management, supplement tracking, and personalized wellness recommendations.

## Project Structure

This project follows a modern microservices architecture with separate frontend and backend codebases:

```
PEAKMODE/
├── frontend/     # React Native (Expo) mobile application
├── backend/      # Node.js/Express API server
└── README.md     # This file
```

## Setup Requirements

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js** (v16+) and **npm** 
2. **MongoDB Community Edition** (v7.0 recommended)
   ```bash
   # Install on macOS with Homebrew
   brew tap mongodb/brew
   brew install mongodb-community@7.0
   ```
3. **Expo CLI**: `npm install -g expo-cli`

## Running Locally

Use our simple local development script to start all components in a single terminal window:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x start-local.sh

# Run the script
./start-local.sh
```

This script will:
- Start a local MongoDB instance
- Run both the backend server and frontend in the same terminal window
- Color-code the output from each service for easy monitoring
- Allow you to see all logs in one place

## Running Components Manually

If you prefer to start each component individually:

### 1. Start MongoDB
```bash
brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community@7.0
```

### 2. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Stopping Services

- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop both backend and frontend
- MongoDB: `brew services stop mongodb/brew/mongodb-community@7.0`
